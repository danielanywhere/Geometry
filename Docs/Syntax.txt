GeometryExample.exe
Test the Geometry library and demonstrate use-cases.

Syntax:
GeometryExample /action:{ActionType} [/count:{Count}]
    [/startPoint:{Coordinate}] [/controlPoint:{Coordinate}]
    [/endPoint:{Coordinate}] [/wait]

Parameters:
    /action         -   The action to take during this call to the
                        application.

    /controlPoint   -   The control point on the line or curve.

    /count          -   The count of items to process.

    /endPoint       -   The end point on the line or curve.

    /startPoint     -   The starting point of the line or curve.

    /wait           -   Value indicating whether to wait for user input after
                        processing has completed and before ending the
                        application.

Values:
    ActionType      -   Recognized actions available in the geometry example
                        application. The following choices are currently
                        available:

                        QuadraticBezierPlotPoints - Generate plot points for
                        a quadratic Bezier curve using incoming start point,
                        control point, and end point values. Required
                        parameters are /startPoint, /controlPoint, /endPoint,
                        and /count.

                        QuadraticBezierPlotPointsEquidistant - Generate
                        equidistantly spaced plot points for a quadratic
                        Bezier curve using incoming start point, control
                        point, and end point values. Required parameters are
                        /startPoint, /controlPoint, /endPoint, and /count.

    Coordinate      -   A pair of numbers, separated by commas, that identify
                        a two dimensional location.

    Count           -   An integer number indicating a count of items or
                        interations to process.

Examples:
In the following examples, note the use of the caret '^' character to continue
the command to the next line in a DOS-based environment. In operating systems
other than Windows, please replace that caret character with the appropriate
line continuation for that command line.

The following example generates 25 points along a quadratic Bezier curve and
outputs the coordinates to the display.

GeometryExample /action:QuadraticBezierPlotPointsEquidistant /count:25^
 /startpoint:0,0 /controlPoint:170,321.566 /endPoint:350,0
